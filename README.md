# A Minimal Relational Ontological Foundation for Physics

## Overview

This repository contains a completed foundational paper proposing a minimal relational ontological framework for physics.

The work does **not** introduce new dynamical laws, fields, or quantization procedures. Instead, it addresses the ontological mismatch between General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics by relocating time, space, probability, and dynamics from fundamental primitives to bookkeeping structures over repeated relational realization.

The framework preserves all empirically validated predictions of existing theories in their tested regimes and introduces a single, explicit point of empirical distinction in strong-gravity domains.

No claim of unification or completeness is made.

## Core Idea (Short Version)

Physical reality is modeled as a space of **relational possibilities**.

* Stable physical entities are **equivalence classes** of relational configurations.
* Time is an **ordering** of realizations, not a flowing background.
* Space measures **relational difference**, not embedding in a manifold.
* Probability is **expected frequency**, not a primitive or subjective notion.
* Dynamics and gravitation emerge as effective descriptions of structured variation in realization rates.

General Relativity and Quantum Mechanics are recovered as **effective bookkeeping frameworks**, each valid under specific structural conditions.

## What This Paper Is *Not*

This work explicitly does **not**:

* Modify Einstein’s field equations in tested regimes
* Propose a new force or interaction
* Quantize spacetime
* Introduce hidden variables or collapse dynamics
* Claim resolution of all quantum gravity problems

Its scope is strictly ontological and structural.

## Key Technical Contributions

* A minimal preorder-based relational ontology defining identity as equivalence classes
* Explicit separation of ontology from representation and bookkeeping
* Derivation of probability as frequency, and the Born rule as a consequence of representation-independence
* Reinterpretation of measurement as stabilization of relational identity
* A strong-gravity prediction: **finite realization-rate saturation** replacing divergent time dilation near horizons

---

## Empirical Status

The framework:

* Is fully consistent with all current weak-field tests of gravity
* Is compatible with existing EHT and LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA observations
* Makes **no fitted claims** and introduces **no free numerical parameters**

Its distinguishing prediction concerns near-horizon behavior in strong-gravity regimes, testable by:

* late-time gravitational wave ringdown
* extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs)
* future space-based detectors (e.g. LISA)

Clear falsification criteria are stated in the paper.
